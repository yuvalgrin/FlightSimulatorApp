We have implemented the MVVM design pattern in our project.
The controls are set in a directory named Views and each one has a separate .xaml file, similarly there is a directory named ViewModels where we hold ViewModel for every View. 
The Model use's the ViewModels as if they are View, and also all of the Views use their respective ViewModel as their model.


Special customizations for the bonus points:
- Design the simulator with a real flight simulator theme using dark colors for the background and punky green on the text and buttons to create a flight atmosphere.
- If we could not initially connect to the server we will auto retry every 5 seconds until the connection is made.
- Support sending multi line commands in the control room
- Error messages are shown in a temporary displayed text designed carefully to keep the flight simulator theme.
- Centralizing the map view onto the airplane for every move he makes.
